Online Backup for WordPress allows you to easily backup your WordPress site with encryption locally, to email, or free 100 MB secure online storage.

== Description ==

Backup Technology's free [Online Backup](http://www.backup-technology.com/) plugin provides protection for WordPress sites and their data. With the vast amount of time and investment that goes into running a blog or website, it is essential that a simple system is available for backing up.

Unlike other plugins, Online Backup for WordPress can even encrypt your backup data to keep it secure while it is downloaded, emailed, and even while it is stored.

The plugin can backup your site's database (containing settings, pages, posts and comments) as well as its filesystem (containing media, attachments, themes and plugins) to any one of three places:

1. A folder on your server
1. Your email inbox
1. Backup Technology's secure data centres with 100 MB **free** online storage space

**Online Backup for WordPress Features:**

* Easy to use
* Configuration checklist to help you get started
* Schedule daily or weekly backups to a local folder, email or free online storage
* Download on-demand backups as a ZIP file
* Backup only files that have changed since the last backup
* Full AES encryption support
* Exclude files and folders
* Exclude comments in trash or marked as spam
* Backup the WordPress parent folder if your WordPress blog is only part of your website
* Free online storage available in secure data centres
* Support forum is actively monitored to help users with any issues
 
*Download the plugin and protect your blog now!*

== Installation ==

Step 1: Install the plugin.

Step 2: Go to the Online Backup page and click General Settings. The defaults are usually fine, but you can tailor to your needs and choose any database content, files or folders that you don't wish to backup.

Step 3: **[Optional]** Register for your 100 MB of free online storage space on our [wordpress backup portal](https://wordpress.backup-technology.com/ "Online Backup for WordPress Portal") and connect the plugin to your storage by clicking Online Backup Settings on the Online Backup page, and entering the username and password you just registered.

Step 4: Schedule when to run your backup by clicking Schedule.

= 2.0.0 =
With version 2.0 you can now backup your blog's files!
WARNING: With version 2.0 you will no longer be able to send a backup to both email and the online vault at the same time in a scheduled backup. If you currently have both set in your schedule, the email option will be removed upon upgrade.

= 1.0.71 =
This update addresses issues with disabling encryption and issues running on Windows servers.

Fixes issues with wp_super_cache plugin and sites where WordPress is in a subfolder. Also fixes the junk error so it correctly reports the real error.
